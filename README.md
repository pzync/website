**Hello! I'm a Designer with experience across Product Creation, Interaction Design and Design Systems. Currently, I head Design at Juspay.** 

At Juspay, I’ve led the design of BHIM app which saw transaction volume of INR 4.8 billion in Mar ’18. I also worked on designing the UPI Common Library. This library is currently installed on ~100 million devices; which would become 300 million with inclusion in WhatsApp soon. Various other Juspay products process 2 million+ transactions every single day.

Previously, I worked as Head of Product at Nestaway, a startup funded over USD 90 million by Yuri Milner, Tiger Global and Tata.

I [write on Medium](https://medium.com/@shekhargurav), dabble in Generative Design using `p5.js` and sometimes also [draw comics](https://yourstory.com/author/shekhar-gurav).
